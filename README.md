# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis

## Overview

Working with AtliQ Grands, a renowned luxury hotel chain, we implemented "Business and Data Intelligence" strategies to revitalize their market share and revenue. Our primary task was to create a dynamic Power BI dashboard to glean insights from their historical data. 

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.

2. Implementing crucial hospitality domain metrics like RevPAR, ADR, DBRN, DSRN, and DURN.

## Results and Impact
