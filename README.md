# AtliQ Hospitality Analysis

## Overview

Working with AtliQ Grands, a renowned luxury hotel chain, we implemented "Business and Data Intelligence" strategies to revitalize their market share and revenue. Our primary task was to create a dynamic Power BI dashboard to glean insights from their historical data. 

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue.


## Areas of focus

1. Developing an interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time data analysis.
2. Implementing crucial hospitality domain metrics like RevPAR, ADR, DBRN, DSRN, and DURN.
3. Analyzing historical data to uncover revenue-enhancing opportunities.
4. Providing actionable insights to guide pricing and occupancy decisions.

## Key Findings

- A non-fluctuating ADR trend in the 3 months data (which is also peak time to the hospitality domain), it is evident that the AtliQ follows a flat price to its rooms
  which would be a reason to the decline of revenue. So changing to a dynamic pricing or week day/weekend pricing will be a better decision
- It is found that there is correlation between average rating of hotel and it's occupancy %. So actions focusing on the reviews given by the customers of hotels having low
  occupancy % will surely boost the business.
- ADR is found to fall on direct online booking platform other than other platforms which shows there is no differential pricing on direct booking platform which reduced the
  revenue generated through it. So providing discount coupons exclusively for direct online booking will help for raising revenue.

## Impact
- Implemented tailored KPI’s and metrics, which could help to 15% increase in revenue and 20% improvement in recapture the market share.
